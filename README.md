# python-api-challenge

WeatherPy

For this challenge, we were tasked with creating a Python script to visualize the weather over 500 cities of varying distance from the equator using the citipy Python library and the OpenWeatherMap API. Multiple plots were created to showcase the relationship between weather variabes (Temperatures, Humidity, Cloudiness, and Wind Speed) vs Latitude. Additionally, a linear regression was computed for each variable with regards to the Northern and Southern Hemisphere.


VacationPy

For this challenge, we were tasked with planning future vacations using the geoViews Python library and Geoapify API. Using the API and libraries, map visualizations were created that displayed every city in the previous dataframe. Additionally, the dataframe was narrowed to find cities with ideal weather conditions. Lastly, the nearest hotel located within 10,000 meters of each cities coordinates were located and displayed on another map for visualization purposes.
